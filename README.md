Subject: use case on linear regression using pytorch.
<br>
<br>
This is a use case on linear regression using pytorch. We generate x_train and y_train values and define a linear regression model 
by inheriting from the base class. We create an instance of the model, define learning rate, optimizer, loss function and train the 
model for 100 epochs. We calculate the outputs and compare with the original values.

Thanks and regards, <br>
Yours sincerely, <br>
